</dd><dt id="reference_accentual-syllabic">accentual-syllabic:</dt><dd>the <a href="#reference_prosody"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prosodic</span></a> mode that dominated English-language poetry 1400-1900, and that this tutorial exclusively addresses. Alike distinct from verse that is <a href="#reference_quantity"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">quantitative</span></a> (measuring duration, as in classical Greek and Latin), accentual (counting only beats, as in Old English), and syllabic (counting only syllables, as in certain: 20th-cy. experiments), accentual-syllabic verse is based on recurrent units (<a href="#reference_foot"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">feet</span></a>) that combine slacks and stresses in fixed sequence.

</dd><dt id="reference_acephalous-line">acephalous line:</dt><dd>a “headless” line in iambic or anapestic meter, which omits (a) slack syllable(s) from the first foot. See also <a href="#reference_catalectic-line">catalectic line</a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_alexandrine">alexandrine:</dt><dd>iambic hexameter line, usually with a strong midpoint <a href="#reference_caesura"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">caesura</span></a>; most familiar in Romance-language poetry but not rare in English.

</dd><dt id="reference_alliteration">alliteration:</dt><dd>repetition of the same initial sound in nearby words. See also <a href="#reference_consonance"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">consonance</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_anapest">anapest:</dt><dd>metrical foot consisting of two slacks and a stress: υ υ /

</dd><dt id="reference_anaphora">anaphora:</dt><dd>repetition of a word or phrase in initial position.

</dd><dt id="reference_assonance">assonance:</dt><dd>harmonious repetition of the same vowel sound in nearby words. See also <a href="#reference_consonance"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">consonance</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_ballad-meter">ballad meter:</dt><dd><a href="#reference_quatrain"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">quatrain</span> </a>in alternating iambic tetrameter and trimeter lines rhyming <em>abxb</em>, traditionally used in folk narrative and during modern times adapted to lyric poetry.

</dd><dt id="reference_blank-verse">blank verse:</dt><dd>unrhymed iambic pentameter. See for contrast <a href="#reference_free-verse"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">free verse</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_caesura">caesura:</dt><dd>mid-line pause, often marked by punctuation but not always. See also <a href="#reference_hemistich"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hemistich</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_catalectic-line">catalectic line:</dt><dd>line lacking one or more of the slack syllables that its meter strictly followed would specify. Also called “defective.” See <a href="#reference_acephalous-line">acephalous line,</a> <a href="#reference_terminal-truncation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">terminal truncation</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_common-measure">common measure:</dt><dd>tetrameter <a href="#reference_quatrain"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">quatrain </span></a>rhyming <em>abab. </em>Also called “hymn stanza.”

</dd><dt id="reference_consonance">consonance:</dt><dd>repetition of the same consonant sound in nearby words; also called “euphony.” See also <a href="#reference_alliteration"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">alliteration</span></a>, <a href="#reference_assonance"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">assonance</span></a>, <a href="#reference_dissonance"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dissonance</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_couplet">couplet:</dt><dd>tersest of rhyming forms, a 2-line pattern of verse, whether free-standing (<em>aa</em>), gathered into stanzas (e.g., <em>aabbcc</em>), or extended at great length in narrative or deliberative poetry: <em>aabbccddeeff. . . </em> .” “Open couplets” make free use of <a href="#reference_enjambed_line"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">enjambed lines</span></a>; “closed couplets” are end-stopped, and are called “heroic couplets” when in iambic pentameter.

</dd><dt id="reference_dactyl">dactyl:</dt><dd>metrical foot consisting of a stress and two slacks: <strong>/ υ υ</strong>

</dd><dt id="reference_dissonance">dissonance:</dt><dd>jam of inharmonious word sounds; also called “cacophony.” See also <a href="#reference_consonance"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">consonance</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_elision">elision:</dt><dd>slurring of two syllables into one, across adjacent vowels or weak voiced consonants; includes conventional poeticisms (“o’er” for “over,” “e’en” for “even”) and nonce phrases so marked (“th’ unseen”) or so treated in scansion, usually to contract an anapest into an iamb.

</dd><dt id="reference_enjambed_line">enjambed line:</dt><dd>a line of verse whose sense runs on, without terminal punctuation, into the next.

</dd><dt id="reference_epigram">epigram:</dt><dd>a very short poem marked by pithy statement and witty turn.

</dd><dt id="reference_feminine-ending">feminine ending:</dt><dd>a line ending whose last syllable is a slack; normal in trochaic and dactylic verse, it also frequently arises in anapestic and even iambic verse. “Feminine rhyme” occurs when like sounds appear in a line’s last stress and the succeeding slacks are repeated exactly, e.g. “gravity” and “suavity.” See also <a href="#reference_masculine-ending"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">masculine ending</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_fixed-forms">fixed forms:</dt><dd>strictly set patterns of meter and/or rhyme or word recurrence. Some, such as the ballade and roundeau, sestina and Petrarchan sonnet, are centuries old; others are of recent invention or adoption, e.g. the clerihew, limerick, roundel, villanelle.

</dd><dt id="reference_foot">foot:</dt><dd>repeating pattern of <a href="#reference_slack"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">slack </span></a>and <a href="#reference_stress"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stressed </span></a>syllables that forms the fundamental unit of <a href="#reference_meter"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">meter</span></a>. The number of feet in a line gives their names to monometer (1), dimeter (2), trimeter (3), tetrameter (4), pentameter (5), hexameter (6, also called <a href="#reference_alexandrine"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">alexandrine</span></a>), heptameter (7, also called “fourteeners”), octometer (8), nonometer (9), the very first and the last two being quite rare. See also <a href="#reference_scansion"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">scansion</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_free-verse">free verse:</dt><dd>unmetered poetry, often exhibiting great rhythmic power and finesse in formal lineation, but outside the scope of this tutorial on metrics. See also <a href="#reference_blank-verse"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">blank verse</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_hemistich">hemistich:</dt><dd>part of a line on either side of a <a href="#reference_caesura"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">caesura</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_iamb">iamb:</dt><dd>metrical foot consisting of a slack and a stress: <strong>υ /</strong>

</dd><dt id="reference_masculine-ending">masculine ending:</dt><dd>line ending where the last syllable is stressed. See also <a href="#reference_feminine-ending"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">feminine ending</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_meter">meter:</dt><dd>the recurring, invariant pattern of <a href="#reference_sla"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">slack </span></a>and <a href="#reference_stress"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stressed </span></a>syllables that a line of accentual-syllabic verse implies, and that the reader infers as an abstract, steady ground against which the actual verse <a href="#reference_r"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">rhythm </span></a>plays its patterns of coincidence or counterpoint. See also <a href="#reference_foot"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">foot</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_octave">octave:</dt><dd>the first eight lines of a <a href="#reference_sonnet"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sonnet</span></a>, almost always a complete rhyming unit. See also <a href="#reference_sestet"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sestet</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_onomatopoeia">onomatopoeia:</dt><dd>the imitation of a sound by the word that denotes it.

</dd><dt id="reference_ottava-rima">ottava rima:</dt><dd>a stanza rhyming <em>abababcc.</em>

</dd><dt id="reference_pitch">pitch:</dt><dd>high or low quality of sounds in a syllable: a property of both consonants and vowels, it is one contributing factor in the determination of stress.

</dd><dt id="reference_promoted-stress">promoted stress:</dt><dd>stress laid, in deference to the metrical pattern, on a word or syllable that would in ordinary speech be slack. Rare in polysyllables since 18th century.

</dd><dt id="reference_prosody">prosody:</dt><dd>study or practice or study of versification: what this tutorial is all about. Also called “metrics” in the case of <a href="#reference_accentual-syllabic"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accentual-syllabic</span></a> poetry.

</dd><dt id="reference_pyrrhic">pyrrhic:</dt><dd>metrical foot consisting of two consecutive slacks: <strong>υ υ </strong>. Occurs only in conjunction with its complementary foot the <a href="#reference_spondee"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">spondee</span></a>, which assumes or borrows its pyrrhic partner’s missing beat.

</dd><dt id="reference_quantity">quantity:</dt><dd>a metrical principle of Greek and Latin <a href="#reference_prosody"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prosody</span></a> tied to the length of syllables spoken or chanted. In antiquity the permutation of long with short quantities gave rise to a veritable foot fetishism, whose taxonomy of terms from amphibrach to syzygy leaves this poor glossary in the dust. The good news for us is that quantity proves practically useless for the analysis of <a href="#reference_accentual-syllabic"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accentual-syllabic</span></a> verse. Even where poets in English deliberately imitate such classical forms as alcaics and sapphics, they rely on stresses and slacks, not longs and shorts.

</dd><dt id="reference_quatrain">quatrain:</dt><dd>four-line stanza. Variants include, in pentameter, the “heroic” or “elegiac quatrain” (<em>abab</em>) and “<em>Rubáiyát</em> quatrain” (<em>aaxa</em>); in tetrameter, the <a href="#reference_ballad-meter"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ballad</span></a>, the <a href="#reference_common-measure"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">common measure</span></a>, the <em>In Memoriam</em> stanza (<em>abba</em>), and the “short measure” (<em>abab</em>, line 3 being pentameter).

</dd><dt id="reference_quintain">quintain:</dt><dd>five-line stanza; forms include the cinquain and limerick.

</dd><dt id="reference_refrain">refrain:</dt><dd>a line of verse that is repeated verbatim within or at the end of a stanza.

</dd><dt id="reference_rhyme">rhyme:</dt><dd>recurrence of like sounds in like verse position, especially the last stressed syllable of a line. In “full” or “perfect” rhyme all sounds but the first are repeated exactly; “identical” rhyme (e.g., “goon” with “lagoon” or “see” with “sea”) is rare, and sounds odd. Rhymes where sounds match only approximately (e.g., “goon” with “son”) are variously called “half,” “imperfect,” “near,” “slant.” “Leonine” rhyme couples a line’s middle syllable with its last; “internal” rhyme may be more loosely distributed. “Eye” rhyme (e.g., “bough” with “rough”) privileges spelling over sound, though in some cases the spelling commemorates a long-lost acoustic resemblance.

</dd><dt id="reference_rhythm">rhythm:</dt><dd>the pattern of <a href="#reference_slack"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">slack </span></a>and <a href="#reference_stress"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stress </span></a>that emerges from a poem as actually voiced, or imaginatively heard. Rhythm implies the poem’s metrical norm, which it both generally observes and (as a rule) tactically disobeys here and there. See also <a href="#reference_m"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">meter</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_scansion">scansion:</dt><dd>the chief object of this on-line tutorial: an analytic process of mapping the convergence and divergence (reinforcement and counterpoint) between the <a href="#reference_meter"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">meter </span></a>of verse and its <a href="#reference_rhythm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">rhythm</span></a>. A poem is scanned by marking its <a href="#reference_stress"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stressed </span></a>and <a href="#reference_slack"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">slack </span></a>syllables and dividing them into <a href="#reference_foot"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">feet</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_sestet">sestet:</dt><dd>the last six lines of a Petrarchan <a href="#reference_sonnet"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sonnet</span></a>; often subtly discernible by tone or mood in a Shakespearean sonnet as well, although less distinctly marked there by rhyme scheme. See also <a href="#reference_octave"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">octave</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_slack">slack:</dt><dd>unstressed syllable in metered verse; scansion mark ∪

</dd><dt id="reference_sonnet">sonnet:</dt><dd>poem of 14 lines usually in iambic pentameter and subdivided by one of two rhyme schemes: “Petrarchan” (or “Italian”) <em>abbaabba cdecde</em> and “English” (or “Shakespearean”) <em>abab cdcd efef gg</em>. See also <a href="#reference_octave">octave</a>, <a href="#reference_sestet"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sestet</span></a>, <a href="#reference_volta"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">volta</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_spenserian-stanza">Spenserian stanza:</dt><dd>8 lines of iambic pentameter followed by a 9<sup>th</sup> hexameter line (<a href="#reference_alexandrine"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">alexandrine</span></a>), rhyming <em>ababbcbcc</em>; named for the Elizabethan poet who inaugurated it in his romance epic <em>The Faerie Queene.</em>

</dd><dt id="reference_spondee">spondee:</dt><dd>metrical foot consisting of two consecutive stresses: <strong>/ / </strong>. Often appears in conjunction with its complementary foot the <a href="#reference_pyrrhic"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pyrrhic</span></a>, whose missing beat it borrows; but often arises independently, as well, to freight a line or retard it.

</dd><dt id="reference_stanza">stanza:</dt><dd>group of lines whose meter and rhyme scheme follow a pattern that is exactly repeated, constituting the structural unit of a stanzaic poem. See also <a href="#reference_strophe"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">strophe</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_stress">stress:</dt><dd>emphasis that a syllable receives in metered verse; scansion mark <strong> ⁄ </strong> Stress may be due to <a href="#reference_accent"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">accent </span></a>(as given in dictionaries for polysyllabic words), to grammar (monosyllabic nouns and adjectives, e.g., routinely taking stress), to context (where a word acquires dramatic or rhetorical force), or, infrequently, to the exigency of <a href="#reference_meter"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">meter</span></a> itself. See also <a href="#reference_slack"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">slack</span></a>, <a href="#reference_promoted-stress"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">promoted stress</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_strophe">strophe:</dt><dd>group of lines forming a typographically discrete portion of a longer poem in irregularly rhymed, coupleted, or blank verse; also called “verse paragraph.” See also <a href="#reference_stanza"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stanza</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_tercet">tercet:</dt><dd>3-line pattern of verses, usually <em>aaa bbb. . . </em>when rhymed, but common in free verse as well; also called “triplet.”

</dd><dt id="reference_terminal-truncation">terminal truncation:</dt><dd>omission, at the end of a trochaic or dactylic line, of (a) slack syllable(s) that the meter strictly followed would specify. See also <a href="#reference_catalectic-line"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">catalectic line</span></a>.

</dd><dt id="reference_terza-rima">terza rima:</dt><dd>sequence of <a href="#reference_tercet"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">tercets</span></a>, as devised for Dante’s <em>Divina Commedia</em>, with interlocking rhyme scheme <em>aba bcb cdc ded. . . .</em>

</dd><dt id="reference_trochee">trochee:</dt><dd>metrical foot consisting of a stress and a slack: <strong>/ υ </strong>

</dd><dt id="reference_volta">volta:</dt><dd>pivot point of a <a href="#reference_sonnet"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sonnet</span></a>, usually at or near the beginning of the 9<sup>th</sup> line.
